    - rotation direction (1, -1)
- sine wave moduation depth
- sine wave modulation rate
- close
- fade out last voices

- load everything from 'synthdefs, funcs...'

- figure out how to make circles and 'waves' for ending section (try using amp follower)
    - 'waves' for bourr√©e section

add flutter to gui (remove amp foll)
- change flutter so each channel is slightly delayed
- parameters:
- flutter rate
- flutter shape (lag time)
- flutter depth
- channel offset delay

out of triangles
follower is there underneath
middle additives go away
top voice additive and simple additive stay
then top voices begins to amp follow voice mass and fade away
voice mass source emerges from follower
follower fades
